- This is a simple program that will allow you to analyze the contents of any .text file and pull up relevant information about the documents size, number of paragraphs, sentences ect.

- I have used  Project Gutenberg http://www.gutenberg.org/ to test this program. If you would like to try out the program, simply find a .txt file you would like on the Project Gutenberg website (or elsewhere, as long as it has a url) and run the file with the command 'Python3 text_parse.py' in your command line, and when prompted, enter the URL to the text file, ex; http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/250/pg250.txt 

- You will have returned to you an object containing some stats on the text you provided =) 

- It's messy and not entirely accurate, but provided a useful learning experience for myself.
